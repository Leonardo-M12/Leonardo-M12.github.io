### List Coloring in Graphs (2024-present)
This project is an initiative led by Professors Hemanshu Kaul from Illinois Tech and Jeffrey Mudrock
from the University of South Alabama. We study the list chromatic number,
a notion derived from the more classical chromatic number, on certain types
of graphs; concretely, those formed from a Cartesian product with a complete
bipartite factor. For more information, I invite you
to read [one of their previous papers on the topic.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02420)


### Exploring Gröbner Bases in Integer Programming (2024)
This was a class project from the Fall 2024 Computational Algebraic Geometry (MATH 431) course
at Illinois Tech. We introduce the notion of Gröbner bases, sets of polynomials
useful for solving polynomial equations, and explore its applications to the 
problem of integer programming. [See the paper here.](/assets/docs/MATH_431_Final_Project.pdf)


### psaverse R Package (2023 - Present)

An R package for the [Psychological Science Accelerator](https://psysciacc.org) (PSA)
designed to standardize project structure and provide utilities largely based on
the `usethis` package. Package website: [https://psysciacc.org/psaverse/](https://psysciacc.org/psaverse/).

### Image Classifier for Pest Detection (2023)

This was my team's submission for the 2022 Samsung Innovation Campus Hackathon,
in which young people from all across Panama took part.

### Measuring the Semantic Priming Effect Across Many Languages (2022)

I contributed with data visualizations from R meta-analysis packages to this
project from the Psychological Science Accelerator, whose output paper
is currently under review for publication in the *Nature Human Behaviour*
journal. Preprint link: [https://osf.io/preprints/osf/q4fjy](https://osf.io/preprints/osf/q4fjy).
