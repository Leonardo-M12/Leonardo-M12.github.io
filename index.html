    <h2>Welcome to my website!</h2>
    <p>I'm Leonardo, an Applied Mathematics major at the Illinois 
        Institute of Technology in Chicago, and I come from Chitre, Panama. </p>
    <p>I'm the Secretary of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics 
        (SIAM) Student Chapter at Illinois Tech, where I write the chapter's weekly 
        newsletter. I'm currently doing research on graph theory, specifically 
        in list coloring, one of the many generalizations of the classical notion 
        of graph coloring. I have also taught as an associate instructor for the 
        math olympiad training program back in Panama, where I myself participated 
        as a contestant during high school.
